game 1 double up
doubleUp: kinda like the game of double and give to the next person. to creating a game is payable (ie u transfer ether to the contract), any anount used to create the game becomes the initial base, to play , u can just double or claim the tokens the game creator cant claim tokens unless the set time elapses, then he can claim if no one claims.

game 2 the pot
the Pot:kinda simulates minning, creating a pot generates a random number using chainlink this number is associated withe pot. to claim pot u pay to generate a random number, if the random number == the pot mine number u get the content of the pot. if the random number != the pot mine number u try again.amount used to generate random number doubles after each attempt, if no one wins the pot within 30 consecutive days the pot usesd to generate the random number gets slashed into 2.
